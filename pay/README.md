A plugin to add payments to your Flutter application.

## Platform Support
| Android | iOS |
|:---:|:---:|
| Google Pay | Apple Pay |

## Getting started
Before you start, create an account with the payment providers you are planning to support and follow the setup instructions:

#### Apple Pay:
1. Take a look at the [integration requirements](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/apple_pay/setting_up_apple_pay_requirements).
2. Create a [merchant identifier](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/configure-app-capabilities/configure-apple-pay#create-a-merchant-identifier) for your business.
3. Create a [payment processing certificate](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/configure-app-capabilities/configure-apple-pay#create-a-payment-processing-certificate) to encrypt payment information.

#### Google Pay:
1. Take a look at the [integration requirements](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/overview).
2. Sign up to the [business console](https://pay.google.com/business/console) and create an account.

## Usage
To start using this plugin, add `pay` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/):

```yaml
dependencies:
  pay: ^3.1.0
```

Define the configuration for your payment provider(s). Take a look at the parameters available in the documentation for [Apple Pay](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/pkpaymentrequest) and [Google Pay](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/reference/request-objects), and explore the [sample configurations in this package](https://github.com/google-pay/flutter-plugin/tree/main/pay/example/lib/payment_configurations.dart).

### Example
This snippet assumes the existence of a payment configuration for Apple Pay ([`defaultApplePayConfigString`](https://github.com/google-pay/flutter-plugin/tree/main/pay/example/lib/payment_configurations.dart#L27)) and another one for Google Pay ([`defaultGooglePayConfigString`](https://github.com/google-pay/flutter-plugin/tree/main/pay/example/lib/payment_configurations.dart#L63)):
```dart
import 'package:pay/pay.dart';

const _paymentItems = [
  PaymentItem(
    label: 'Total',
    amount: '99.99',
    status: PaymentItemStatus.final_price,
  )
];

ApplePayButton(
  paymentConfiguration: PaymentConfiguration.fromJsonString(
      defaultApplePayConfigString),
  paymentItems: _paymentItems,
  style: ApplePayButtonStyle.black,
  type: ApplePayButtonType.buy,
  margin: const EdgeInsets.only(top: 15.0),
  onPaymentResult: onApplePayResult,
  loadingIndicator: const Center(
    child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
  ),
),

GooglePayButton(
  paymentConfiguration: PaymentConfiguration.fromJsonString(
      defaultGooglePayConfigString),
  paymentItems: _paymentItems,
  type: GooglePayButtonType.buy,
  margin: const EdgeInsets.only(top: 15.0),
  onPaymentResult: onGooglePayResult,
  loadingIndicator: const Center(
    child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
  ),
),

void onApplePayResult(paymentResult) {
  // Send the resulting Apple Pay token to your server / PSP
}

void onGooglePayResult(paymentResult) {
  // Send the resulting Google Pay token to your server / PSP
}
```

### Alternative methods to load your payment configurations
#### JSON strings
The example above uses the `PaymentConfiguration.fromJsonString` method to load your payment configuration from a string in JSON format ([example](https://github.com/google-pay/flutter-plugin/tree/main/pay/example/lib/payment_configurations.dart#L27)). This configuration can be retrieved from a remote location at runtime ([recommended](https://github.com/google-pay/flutter-plugin/tree/main/pay/example/lib/payment_configurations.dart#L18)) or provided at build time.

#### Asset files
You can also place payment configurations under your `assets` folder and load them at runtime. Suppose that you add a JSON file with the name `google_pay_config.json` to your `assets` folder to configure your Google Pay integration. You can load it and use it to create a `PaymentConfiguration` object for the button (e.g.: using a `FutureBuilder`):

```dart
final Future<PaymentConfiguration> _googlePayConfigFuture = 
    PaymentConfiguration.fromAsset('google_pay_config.json');

FutureBuilder<PaymentConfiguration>(
    future: _googlePayConfigFuture,
    builder: (context, snapshot) => snapshot.hasData
        ? GooglePayButton(
          paymentConfiguration: snapshot.data!,
          paymentItems: _paymentItems,
          type: GooglePayButtonType.buy,
          margin: const EdgeInsets.only(top: 15.0),
          onPaymentResult: onGooglePayResult,
          loadingIndicator: const Center(
            child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
          ),
        )
        : const SizedBox.shrink()),
```

## Advanced usage
If you prefer to have more control over each individual request and the button separately, you can instantiate a payment client and add the buttons to your layout independently:

```dart
import 'package:pay/pay.dart';

const _paymentItems = [
  PaymentItem(
    label: 'Total',
    amount: '99.99',
    status: PaymentItemStatus.final_price,
  )
];

final Pay _payClient = Pay({
  PayProvider.google_pay: payment_configurations.defaultGooglePayConfig,
  PayProvider.apple_pay: payment_configurations.defaultApplePayConfig,
});
```

As you can see, you can add multiple configurations to your payment client, one for each payment provider supported.

Now, you can use the `userCanPay` method to determine whether the user can start a payment process with a given provider. This call returns a `Future<bool>` result that you can use to decide what to do next. For example, you can feed the `Future` to a `FutureBuilder` that shows a different UI based on the result of the call:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return FutureBuilder<bool>(
    future: _payClient.userCanPay(PayProvider.apple_pay),
    builder: (context, snapshot) {
      if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {
        if (snapshot.data == true) {
          return RawApplePayButton(
              type: ApplePayButtonType.buy,
              onPressed: _onApplePayPressed);
        } else {
          // userCanPay returned false
          // Consider showing an alternative payment method
        }
      } else {
        // The operation hasn't finished loading
        // Consider showing a loading indicator 
      }
    },
  );
}
```
Finally, handle the `onPressed` event and trigger the payment selector as follows:

```dart
void _onApplePayPressed() async {
  final result = await _payClient.showPaymentSelector(
    PayProvider.apple_pay,
    _paymentItems,
  );
  // Send the resulting Google Pay token to your server / PSP
}
```

### Handling a payment result response (Android only)
On Android, payment results are received using an event channel, in order to eliminate the effect of lost references during activity recreation events. Because of that, calls to `Pay.showPaymentSelector` only initiate the payment process and don't return any result.

To subscribe to the result stream, create an `EventChannel` using the payment results channel name (`plugins.flutter.io/pay/payment_result`) and start listening to events:

```dart
static const eventChannel =
    EventChannel('plugins.flutter.io/pay/payment_result');
final _paymentResultSubscription = eventChannel
    .receiveBroadcastStream()
    .map((result) => jsonDecode(result as String) as Map<String, dynamic>)
    .listen((result) {
      // TODO: Send the resulting Google Pay token to your server / PSP
    }, onError: (error) {
      // TODO: Handle errors
    });
```

Make sure to cancel the subscription and clear the reference when it is not needed anymore:

```dart
_paymentResultSubscription.cancel();
_paymentResultSubscription = null;
```

See the [advanced example](https://github.com/google-pay/flutter-plugin/blob/main/pay/example/lib/advanced.dart) to see a working integration.
