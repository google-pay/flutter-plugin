# Changelog

## 3.1.0 (2025-01-10)
Introduce new payment methods available in [`PKPaymentNetwork`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/pkpaymentnetwork). See the [changelog for `pay_ios:1.1.0`](../pay_ios/CHANGELOG.md#110-2025-01-10)
for further details.

## 3.0.1 (2024-12-24)

### Fixes

* Include a circuit-breaker in the payment buttons when the platform where the logic is run is not supported. This prevents running superflous business logic, and limits configuration complexity.

## 3.0.0 (2024-12-23)
### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGE

Introduce an event channel to communicate the Flutter and native ends for Android integrations. This change is only breaking for users of the [advanced integration](https://pub.dev/packages/pay#advanced-usage). Other paths are unaffected and can use this version transparently.

### Features

* Use an event channel to handle payment result information on Android.
* Add a complete example of the advanced integration path (see [`advanced.dart`](example/lib/advanced.dart)).

### Fixes

* ([#277](https://github.com/google-pay/flutter-plugin/issues/277), [#274](https://github.com/google-pay/flutter-plugin/issues/274), [#261](https://github.com/google-pay/flutter-plugin/issues/261), [#206](https://github.com/google-pay/flutter-plugin/issues/206)) Avoid lifecycle conflicts on Android when the activity managing the payment operation is re-created before the payment result is returned.

## 3.0.0-beta.2 (2024-10-10)

Include logic to prevent a subscription for payment result `EventChannel`s from being created on platforms that don't support it.

### ⚠ DEPRECATION WARNING

### Features

* Widgets inheriting from `PayButton` now receive the payment configuration using the `paymentConfiguration` parameter, which expects a `PaymentConfiguration` object. This allows building configuration objects from assets or strings (see [#7](https://github.com/google-pay/flutter-plugin/issues/7)). The previous `paymentConfigurationAsset` property is still available and marked as deprecated for backwards compatibility, and will be removed in future releases. See the new example application and readme to learn more.
* Use a `Map` to configure a `Pay` client, where the key is a `PayProvider` and the value is a `PaymentConfiguration`. 

## 1.0.11 (2022-09-14)

* Update `pay_android` to `1.0.8`, which includes the new specification for the Google Pay button.

## 1.0.10 (2022-06-01)

* Update `pay_ios` to `1.0.7`, which adds the `transactionIdentifier` property to the payment result.

* Add support for Flutter 3 in the sample application.
* Update `pay_android` to `1.0.7`, which adds support for Flutter 3 to the package.

## 1.0.8 (2022-01-31)

* Update `pay_ios` to `1.0.6`, which adds `postalAddress` to the payment result.

## 1.0.7 (2022-01-04)

* Update `pay_android` to `1.0.6`, which uses a stable version of `flutter_svg`.

## 1.0.6 (2021-10-04)

### Features

* Make the package available for iOS versions lower than 12.0 ([#36](https://github.com/google-pay/flutter-plugin/issues/36)).
* Capture the dismissal of the payment selector and expose it to the Flutter end through the `onError` callback ([#90](https://github.com/google-pay/flutter-plugin/issues/90), [#61](https://github.com/google-pay/flutter-plugin/issues/61)).

### Fixes

* Fix not being able to capture a payment result on the second and further payment attempts ([#80](https://github.com/google-pay/flutter-plugin/issues/80)).

## 1.0.5 (2021-06-08)

### Fixes

* Expose the `PaymentConfiguration` class through the `pay` package ([#53](https://github.com/google-pay/flutter-plugin/issues/53)).
